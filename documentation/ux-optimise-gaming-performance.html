    5 Ways to Optimise Your Android Device for Gaming Performance
</h2>
<p>
    ‌While Android phones are well-known for their gaming prowess, you’ll
    sometimes find that older models are let down by their performance.
    However, you don’t need to buy a new phone to continue enjoying a smooth
    gaming experience; you can improve the performance of your current device
    by optimising your <a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a> phone for
    gaming performance.
</p>
<h3><strong>
    <a name="_z856u5c59gcn"></a>
    Update Your Android Operating System
</strong></h3>
<p>
    ‌One of the best ways to improve your gaming performance is to regularly
    update your Android device. Many operating system updates include bug fixes
    or performance improvements that will automatically make your gaming
    experience more enjoyable. Plus, they often come with security fixes to
    ensure your device remains secure while you enjoy all the games the
    internet has to offer. If you start to see a decrease in your phone’s
    gaming performance, check to see if any updates are available.
</p>
<h3><strong>

    Disable Unnecessary Apps
</strong></h3>
<p>
    ‌Another common reason why your phone may be running slowly is because of
    unnecessary apps running in the background. It’s amazing how many of these
    apps pile up over time, and they’re all taking away vital resources from
    your game. By closing these apps and disabling the ones you don’t use, you
    free up more memory and processing power which can be used to run your
    game, vastly improving your device’s performance.
</p>
<h3><strong>

    Use a Game Booster App
</strong></h3>
<p>
    ‌If you want to maximise the power that’s available to you in your phone’s
hardware, you may want to consider downloading a game booster app such as    <a href="https://www.razer.com/eu-en/cortex/boost">Razor Cortex</a>. These
    apps are designed to optimise your system resources for gaming, ensuring
    that you have a smooth, lag-free experience. They work by managing various
    aspects of your phone, routing performance away from unneeded apps and
    towards your game. Some of the best game booster apps can even optimise
    your network connectivity to give you better server responses and faster
    pings!
</p>
<h3><strong>
    <a name="_wd7c46rjdkao"></a>
    Clear Cache and Data
</strong></h3>
<p>
    You’ll find that the more full a phone’s storage is, the worse that phone
    performs over time. Cached data can build up over time across multiple
    different apps and end up slowing down your phone’s performance. By
    clearing this data, you can free up some much-needed storage space on your
    phone, improving your gaming performance. This is particularly important
    when playing high-quality games and online slots such as
    <a href="https://www.platincasino.com/ie/merkur-games.html">
        Merkur Casino Games
    </a>
    or Modern Combat 5. It’s best practice to clear your phone’s cached data
    every couple of weeks to ensure it doesn’t start to impact your phone’s
    performance.
</p>
<h3><strong>

    Adjust Graphics Settings
</strong></h3>
<p>
    ‌As games are becoming more graphically intensive, it’s more important than
    ever to ensure that your graphics settings are appropriate for the
    performance capabilities of your device. The fact of the matter is that not
    every Android phone will be capable of running the latest games on the
    highest graphical settings without experiencing some sort of negative
    performance impact. By reducing the graphical and animation settings on
    your device, you can vastly improve its gaming performance, even if it is
    at the cost of graphics quality.
</p>

    Conclusion
</strong></h3>
<p>
    By following these simple tricks, you can optimise your Android device for
    gaming performance, giving you a much better gaming experience. All of the
    tips we’ve listed can help improve your phone’s performance, so why not
    give them a try the next time your Android is running slower than expected?
